# 📂 File Organizer System (Frontend Project)

A simple **File Organizer System UI** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project simulates a basic file management interface where files are automatically categorized based on their extensions and displayed in folders.

Users can browse files, edit file names, delete files to a bin, search files, and clear the bin.  
The project demonstrates **DOM manipulation, local storage usage, and interactive UI behavior using vanilla JavaScript.**
